# Deliverator
A REST client that isn't trying to sell you something.

## I just wanna run it
Grab the latest [release](https://github.com/sodle/deliverator/releases) for your platform.

## Developing

### Requirements (I think?)

- Node 21+/Yarn
- Rust/Cargo

### Run the thing

```bash
yarn
yarn tauri dev
```

### Hey this thing sucks!

Yeah. But it's not a cloud service demanding an account and pushing a paid business offering, like any of [Postman, Insomnia, RapidAPI, etc.].

Feel free to contribute. Or just use curl.
